# Data-Mining-Scienctific
A repository containing the algorithm for data mining taken from many sources, mainly the scientifical paper from Professor, PhD, Master of Engineer in Vietnam. This repository is served for study purpose. Please contact me if you want to use the code in this repository.

CCAR algorithm - an efficient method to mine the class association rule with item constraints
The idea is taken from this paper (also my teacher at master class)
